These are the five assignments I was most proud of. 
The baseball game allows you to enter in your prefrences like places to live, colors, and fruits. These choices lead you to a MLB player.
The conditional statements work together with eachother to make the best fit

The math quiz is a good way for people to get better at math and do it quickly. The numbers range a lot so there is not a lot of repitition. Since is gives you feedback, you can truly improve
It allows yo to pick difficulty and the number of questions
Shows how long you took and how many you got correct per questions given
Tells you what you get right and wrong as soon as you answer

The number gueesser is a game where the user hasto guess the number 1-10. The player has 3 guesses, and gets feedback after each one
The code will print, " Too high" or "Too low", but then on the next turn you may be able to narrow it down for your third guess

The pokemon game is my favorite, becuase you ave to choose what you want to do each day to buil your Pokemon. You can either rest, battle, or train, and at the end you get to fight the final boss to become king of the city.
Training at the start is best, because you neeed to get strong enough to battle but once you can battle, you improve much faster
At the end it shows you the current day, your level, and your pokemon. 

My last project is the calculator. The calculator is a pretty simple artimetic problem solver.
You can do addition, subtrraction, multiplication, and division with ANY two numbers the user feeds into the calculator.
